          Indoor AIR is an indoor air quality monitoring system which monitors
          the air quality of particular place and provide real-time indoor air
          quality (IAQ) value whose represents which has determine the quality
          of air that we are breathing. Our system uses IoT devices(sensors)
          that has to collect pollutants data like level of co2, ozone, So2,
          smoke that is present in the air. Furthermore, based on the level of
          pollutants and IAQ value it also suggest the necessary safety
          measures.

        <p className="indoor-air-about-text">
          Indoor AIR is a college project and have some limitations like it
          can’t measure all the pollutants that a present in the air. But in the
          future we will manage the corresponding to measures as much as
          possible pollutants and try to provide very accurate air quality data.
